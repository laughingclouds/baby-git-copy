Baby-GIT - the baby stupid content tracker
==========================================

\[**[Link to article that helps you with the whole project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/boost-programming-skills-read-git-code/)**\]

"Baby-git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

 - random letter combination that is pronounceable, and not
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronounciation of "baby-got-back" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid baby. contemptible and despicable baby. simple baby. Take
   your pick from the dictionary of baby slang.
 - "baby global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Baby angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room. 
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of baby sh*t": when it breaks

Note: If you are looking for the original README file, it has been renamed
to `README.torvalds`.

This is a fully documented codebase of the very first commit of Git, introduced
to the world by Linus Torvalds in 2005. I created this project for educational,
informational, and historic purposes.

It is my suspicion that the vast majority of us Git users are basically oblivious
to the inner workings of a tool that we use every day. This project addresses
this by attempting to clearly and thoroughly document the first (and correspondingly
simplest - it is only ~1000 lines of code!) version of the tool for ease of
understanding by the average joe developer.

Let's be honest here, Linus is a genius programmer, and his ultra-efficient coding
style reflects this.  But the level of documentation in his code (i.e. minimalist)
assumes mastery of the C language and low-level programming concepts in order to
understand WTF his code is actually doing. This in turn makes us mere mortals feel
like a bunch of baby-gits.

Here's to all the baby-gits out there who would like to learn a little bit more
about a tool that has helped shape software development today. It amazed me how the
~1000 lines of code in this initial release have accomplished so much, and I hope
it will amaze you too!
